# LenoxBot

**Welcome to the LenoxBot Documentation!**

LenoxBot was created on **September 5th**. Since then we have released over **2000** updates and spent over **1000** hours making the bot more user-friendly than any other bot!

Our goal was and still is to provide every bot user an all-in bot so he/she doesn't have to invite 10 other bots for all the features that he wants to have on his/her Discord server.

We released our own website including the dashboard in May and it offers you a place where you can set up almost all settings of the bot via your browser!

    More about our website and Dashboard can be found **[here](https://docs.lenoxbot.com/General%20FAQ/Website/dashboard/)**.

If you are a new user of LenoxBot, we would advise you to read on **[Getting started](https://docs.lenoxbot.com/gettingstarted/)** so that you will quickly become familiar with LenoxBot!
